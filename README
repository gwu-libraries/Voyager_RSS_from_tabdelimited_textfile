This perl script takes a tab-delimited text file as input and generates a set of RSS files as output. 
The text file has been sorted by LC call number, and it includes a unique bibid number for each title. 
The script constructs a hyperlink using the bibid which links to the OPAC record.

usage: cat sortedfile.tab | ./makeRss.pl

Sample files on this repository include a 
tab-delimited text file (sortedfile.tab) and 
two of the generated RSS xml files, newgelmanbooks.xml and newgelmanbooksT.xml. 

The xml files may be opened in a web browser for an RSS view.
